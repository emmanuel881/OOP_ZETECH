### File 1
* A program is required that prompts the user to enter point (x,y) and checks if point is within a circle centered (0,0) with a radius 10
* For example (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9)is outside the circle.
* Hint: a point is in the circle if distance between (x, y) and center of the circle is less than or equal to radius.
* the formular for computing distance is 

```
√((x2 - x1) + (y2 - y1))

```
